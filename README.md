# Mobile-battery-charging-alert

Objective:
To alert the mobile phone user about the battery level of the phone while it is going low
by making an android app.

Basic Idea:
In our day to day busy life we have no time to keep track the charging percentage of our
smart phone which has a lot of apps and which brings the world in front of us .In today’s life our
phone has become one of the most important device. Sometimes people may forget about phone
and keep doing their own work and the phone reaches its dead point and gets switched off.
Sometimes people put music in the phone and do their household works, after some time it gets
switched off. In night times when people are sleeping the phone can get switched off because of
the apps that they are using consumes a lot of battery power.
So, in order avoid all these type of obstacles we would like to develop an android app that
provides a voice alert when our phone reaches 15% of the battery charging and reminds that’s
the phone needs to get charged ASAP.
